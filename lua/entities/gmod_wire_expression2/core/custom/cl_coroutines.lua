desc("coroutine(s)","Creates a coroutine object to be run with xco:resume()")
desc("coroutineRunning()","Returns an array, the first object being a number 1 or 0 whether there is a coroutine running, the second being the coroutine running.")

-- Metamethods
desc("xco:status()","Returns a string of the status of the coroutine, 'dead' for finished, 'suspended' for yielded, and 'running' for obvious reasons")
desc("xco:wait(n)","Makes a coroutine wait for n amount of seconds, in this time, it is yielded and cannot be resumed.")
desc("xco:yield()","Makes the coroutine pause until it is resumed again. It will remember everything that is happening")
desc("xco:reboot()","Returns a coroutine object that behaves as if the coroutine given was never started or was reset, 'rebooting' it.")

-- Try & Catch ( Kind of separate )

desc("try(s)","Tries to run the first function, and returns an array with the first element being a number 1 or 0 for whether it successfully ran, and the next either being the error message or the return value of the 'try' function.")

-- With catching
desc("try(s,s)","Tries to run the first function, returns the same as try(s) but also calls a second callback function with the same results.")
